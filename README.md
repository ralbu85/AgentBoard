AgentBoard is a browser-based command center for running many AI coding agents in parallel — across as many machines as you like. Spawn Claude Code, Codex, Aider, or any shell-based agent in its own `tmux` session, switch between them with a tap, and pick up exactly where you left off — from your laptop, your tablet, or your phone. Sessions running on several PCs (even behind NAT) aggregate into one dashboard.

> Designed for the moment your agents outgrow a single terminal tab — and then a single machine.

## Why AgentBoard

Modern coding agents are most useful when they run for **minutes or hours**, not seconds. Soon you're juggling three, five, ten of them — and `tmux` alone gets old fast on mobile. AgentBoard wraps `tmux` in a clean dashboard that:

- **Just works on mobile.** Real touch scroll with momentum, no broken gestures, no pinch traps. Built and tuned on actual devices, not emulators.
- **Knows what each agent is doing.** Each session shows an `idle` / `working` / `waiting` badge derived from its terminal output.
- **Refuses to lose state.** Sessions live in `tmux` — they survive page reloads, server restarts, and flaky networks.
- **Is honestly fast.** 80 ms screen refresh on the session you're looking at, 2 s on the rest. Adaptive, never wasteful.

## Built for these moments

- **Long-running refactors** — kick off an agent at your desk, check its progress from your phone over coffee, tap once to send `y` when it asks for confirmation.
- **Parallel coding** — three agents on three branches, one dashboard, zero context-switching tax.
- **Pair-programming with yourself** — the same `tmux` state, viewed live from any device on the network.
- **Tablet-first development** — file browser, code editor, PDF viewer, and a live terminal — all in one tab.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Multi-session terminal** | Spawn, kill, rename, and switch between unlimited `tmux` sessions |
| **Multi-machine** | Aggregate sessions from several PCs in one dashboard; remote agents dial out, so NAT/firewalls are no obstacle |
| **Mobile-first UI** | Custom touch handlers — momentum scroll, scroll-to-bottom, on-screen keys (PgUp/PgDn, ⌫), keyboard-friendly input |
| **Live state detection** | Per-session badges: `idle`, `working`, `waiting-for-input` |
| **Push notifications** | Web Push fires an OS notification when a session goes `waiting` or `completed` — even on iOS (installed PWA) |
| **Adaptive polling** | 80 ms on the active session, 2 s on background sessions |
| **File browser & editor** | CodeMirror 6 with syntax highlighting for 13+ languages, plus a git-diff view |
| **Markdown + KaTeX** | Notion-style rendered view, clickable task-list checkboxes, sanitized HTML, math rendered server-free |
| **Jupyter notebooks** | Read-only `.ipynb` viewer — rendered cells, syntax-highlighted code, images/tables/errors |
| **PDF & image viewer** | PDF zoom (50–300%), fit-to-width; images pan/zoom; all lazy-loaded for instant boot |
| **Cookie auth** | Single password, HMAC-SHA256 signed, per-IP login throttling |
| **Optional Cloudflare tunnel** | Expose the dashboard publicly with one env var |
| **Survives everything** | `tmux`-backed sessions persist across reloads, restarts, and disconnects |

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ralbu85/AgentBoard.git
cd AgentBoard

# Backend (Python 3.12 + FastAPI)
python3.12 -m venv backend/.venv
backend/.venv/bin/pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Frontend (React + Vite)
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Configuration — path is set in backend/config.py
mkdir -p /root/TermHub
cat > /root/TermHub/.env <<EOF
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=changeme
AGENTBOARD_PORT=3002
EOF

# Build the frontend and start the server
./deploy.sh
```

Open `http://localhost:3002`, log in, hit **+ New** — and you're spawning agents.

## Notes for contributors

A few non-obvious decisions that have already burned someone:

- **Static assets are served `no-cache`.** Build outputs use fixed names (`app.js`, `index.css`); cache busting is via a `?v=<timestamp>` query injected by `deploy.sh`. **Never** add a client-side `setTimeout` auto-reload — it loops on slow mobile.
- **xterm.js native touch is disabled** (`pointer-events: none` on `.xterm*`). A custom handler on `.xterm-wrap` drives mobile scroll. Playwright's CDP touch direction is the **opposite** of real devices — trust real-device feedback over emulator output.
- **Raw stream is not applied to the client.** Pipe-pane output contains escape sequences that destroy the scrollback. The client receives `writeScreen` (in-place capture-pane) and a one-time `writeSnapshot` on session switch.
- **Always launch from the project root.** `start.sh` and `deploy.sh` handle this — they `cd` first so `backend.main` resolves correctly.
